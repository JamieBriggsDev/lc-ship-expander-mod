# ShipExpander
This is [ShipExpander](https://github.com/JamieBriggsDev/lc-ship-expander-mod).

ShipExpander makes the in game ship wider to help facilitate lobbies 
with more than 4 people. This is done via a "bigger on the inside" style approach. 
This includes:
- Two versions of the ship existing:
  - The inside ship which is spawned away from the world, and is stretched
  - The outside ship which is placed in the original position.

By doing it this way, the ship can be made larger, without it looking out of place
in the game world (e.g. clipping through in game scenery).
